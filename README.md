#Work still in progress#

Balls will appear and bounce between the borders of the game.  
Player need to destroy them. How?  
Well, he will use the finger (mobile) or mouse (pc) to draw a line in the screen.  
If the line is closed in time, all the balls inside will be destroyed.  
If the balls collide with the line while it is open, the line is destroyed.  

The more balls you can get inside one closed line, more points for you, but be careful, the faster you draw a line the thinner it gets.
