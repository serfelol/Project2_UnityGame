Project 2 - Learning Unity and Game Dev.

Balls will appear and bounce between the borders of the game.
Player need to destroy them. How?
Well, he will use the finger (mobile) or mouse (pc) to create a line in the screen.
If the line is closed in time, all the balls inside of it will be destroyed.
If the balls collide with the line while it is open the line is destroyed.

The more balls you can get inside one closed line, more points for you, but be carful, the faster you draw a line the thiner it gets.
